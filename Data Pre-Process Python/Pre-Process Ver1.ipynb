[]}{LEGALLIZATION}\\n(4) Cate's reply to buy at $1500 is also a counter offer {CO-REFERENCE (3)}\\n(5) Alan did not accept Cate's counter offer but he made another counter offer that he would only sell the book for $2000 {AND} he would keep his offer open for seven days. {CO-REFERENCE(3)}\\n(6) IF acceptance is made by post THEN it takes effect upon posting  {Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681[]} {LEGALLIZATION}\\n(7) {HOWEVER} Alan's offer has a specification of mode of offer therefore postal rule does not apply {AND} Cate's acceptance is invalid {Section 7b} {LEGALLIZATION}\\n(8) IF Cate's acceptance is not valid THEN Alan can revoke his offer {Section 5.1}{LEGALLIZATION}\\n(9) {HOWEVER} revocation only takes effect when it is communicated to Cate {Section 6a} {LEGALLIZATION} \\n(10) The revocation has been communicated by David when he told Cate that he had bought a copy of Kidnapped from Alan for $7, 000 because communication of revocation can be made by third party so long as it is reliable {Routledge v Grant (1828) 4 Bing 653[]}{LEGALLIZATION} \\n(11) IF offer has been revoked THEN Cate cannot accept the offer therefore there is no valid contract {COMMON_SENSE}\",\n",
