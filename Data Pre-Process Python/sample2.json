    "Analysis": "(1) According to {Eckhardt Marine GmbH v Sheriff, High Court of Malaya, Seremban (2001) 4 MLJ 49[]} THEN Alan's advertisement to sell the book for $1000 is an invitation to treat {LEGALLIZATION}\n(2) IF Alan's advertisement to sell the book for $1000 is an invitation to treat THEN Cate's reply to buy the book for $ 1000 is an offer. {Section 4.1} {LEGALLIZATION}\n(3) Alan's reply saying that he could not sell the book for less than $2000 is not an acceptance because acceptance must be absolute and unqualified.{Section 7a} {LEGALLIZATION} {AND} since Alan changed the price from $1500 to $2000, he made a counter offer which in effect destroyed Cate's original offer {Malayan Flour Mills Bhd v Saw Eng Chee (Administrator of the estate of Saw Cheng Chor, decd) (1997) 1 MLJ 763. []}{LEGALLIZATION}\n(4) Cate's reply to buy at $1500 is also a counter offer {CO-REFERENCE (3)}\n(5) Alan did not accept Cate's counter offer but he made another counter offer that he would only sell the book for $2000 {AND} he would keep his offer open for seven days. {CO-REFERENCE(3)}\n(6) IF acceptance is made by post THEN it takes effect upon posting  {Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681[]} {LEGALLIZATION}\n(7) {HOWEVER} Alan's offer has a specification of mode of offer therefore postal rule does not apply {AND} Cate's acceptance is invalid {Section 7b} {LEGALLIZATION}\n(8) IF Cate's acceptance is not valid THEN Alan can revoke his offer {Section 5.1}{LEGALLIZATION}\n(9) {HOWEVER} revocation only takes effect when it is communicated to Cate {Section 6a} {LEGALLIZATION} \n(10) The revocation has been communicated by David when he told Cate that he had bought a copy of Kidnapped from Alan for $7, 000 because communication of revocation can be made by third party so long as it is reliable {Routledge v Grant (1828) 4 Bing 653[]}{LEGALLIZATION} \n(11) IF offer has been revoked THEN Cate cannot accept the offer therefore there is no valid contract {COMMON_SENSE}",
