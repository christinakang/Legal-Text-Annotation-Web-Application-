Farrah runs a small catering business specialising in Malaysian cuisines. Her van breaks down when she was on her way to deliver her orders. She calls her local garage, Giant Auto Workshop, who agree to send out Harris, a mechanic to repair the van. Harris tells Farrah that the van cannot be repaired at the roadside but will have to be towed to the garage. Farrah agrees to this.

Harris winches up Farrah’s van in order to tow it to the garage, but a worn clip on the towing gear used by Harris slips open causing the van to fall. The van runs backwards over Farrah’s leg, breaking her ankle. The van’s rear window shatters in the fall and the food spills all over the road surface.

Displayed on the back of the towing vehicle is a notice: ‘All towing takes place at the customer’s risks.  Giant Auto Workshop and their employees accept no liability for any damage, injury, or any consequential loss, howsoever caused, while a motor vehicle is being towed.’
