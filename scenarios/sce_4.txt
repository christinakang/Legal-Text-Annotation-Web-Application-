Ellie’s Montblanc pen with her name engraved on it was stolen. She puts an advertisement on her personal blog advertising a reward of RM1,000 to anyone who finds it. Frank, who has not seen the advertisement, discovers the pen in a library locker and takes it home. His course mate, Galvin, on seeing the pen, recognizes it as the one for which the reward has been offered, and shows Frank the advertisement in Ellie’s blog. Frank returns the pen to Ellie, but she refuses to pay RM 1,000, saying that the offer has been withdrawn. 

Frank knows that Galvin has been keen to buy his vintage Vespa scooter. On Sunday he tells Galvin that he has decided to sell at RM 5,000. Galvin says that he is very interested but would like to think about it. Frank says ‘I will assume that you want it, unless you tell me otherwise by Friday’.

On Thursday, Galvin meets Hassan who tells him that Frank has just agreed to sell the scooter to Jaya for RM6,000. Galvin immediately texted Frank accepting his offer. Later that day, however, Galvin changes his mind and calls on Frank to tell him to ignore the text message. Frank tells him that his deal with Jaya has fallen through, and he is still keen to sell it to Galvin.
