Gary and his wife hold the Mooncake Festival each year on the grounds of their family estate in Kuala Selangor. The festival has increased in popularity, and this year they anticipate a record attendance. To cope with the extra demand, Gary contacts Hire-a-Loo Sdn. Bhd. to rent 10 portable toilets. Hire-a-Loo agrees to deliver and install all the toilets on 21st September, 2 days before the festival begins, and to collect them on 26th September, 2 days after the festival ends. 

On 21st September, when Hire-a-Loo attempts to install the toilets rented by Gary, it becomes apparent that a number of its portable toilets had been returned damaged by a previous customer, and would need to be repaired before further use. Gary and his wife, aware that the festival cannot go ahead without adequate toilet facilities, offer Hire-a-Loo an additional sum of RM5,000 to repair the portable toilets by 23rd September. Hire-a-Loo agrees and installs all the portable toilets by 23rd September. 

Monsoon rain in Kuala Selangor on 23-24 September badly affects attendance at the festival. When Hire-a-Loo comes to collect the portable toilets on 26th September, Gary and his wife say they can no longer afford to pay the additional RM5,000.
