On 1 November, Ahmad who lives next door to Hussain called on Hussain and offer to sell his IBM computer for RM2,000 .
On 3 November, Hussain wrote and posted a letter to Ahmad accepting the offer.
The letter was not addressed properly.
Hence Ahmad received the letter of acceptance on 8 November instead of on 5 November.
On the evening of 6 November, Ahmad telephoned Hussain and said ‘I revoke my offer to you’.
