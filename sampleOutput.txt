 sections: 4.2a 
 Related Court Case: Ignatius v Bell (1913) 2 FMLSR 115 
 Court case page/paragraph num: 20 
 Analysis : In S.4(2)(a) Contracts Act 1950, it provides that the person making the offer (offeror) is bound when the letter of acceptance has been posted irrespective of whether it has been delayed or lost in the course of transit. If Ahmad had revoked the offer by way of telephone, then this revocation would not take place as he had received the letter of acceptance from Hussain. 
 Conclustion: Therefore, Ahmad cannot revoke his offer as he is bound in law to accept the letter of acceptance once it has been posted.
