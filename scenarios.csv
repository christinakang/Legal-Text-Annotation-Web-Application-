2,"Cathy’s son, Dave, aged 21, was studying for a diploma in computer science at a University in Kuala Lumpur. He lived in a student residence. It was a city council legislative requirement that it was illegal to smoke in student residence, offices, shops, or any enclosed place where someone else is residing, studying or working within the campus. Dave gave up smoking due to this requirement.

However, Cathy was worried that under the pressure of preparing for the examination Dave would start smoking again, and so she promised to pay Dave RM500 if he did not smoke at all until he had completed the course. She also promised to buy him a car if he passed the examinations.

Cathy run an online bookstore, and asked Dave to maintain and update the website from time to time. She was pleased with the result, and said she would give him RM1,000 ‘for all his hard work’.  

Dave passed his examinations, obtained his diploma and moved to live in Johor Bahru where there was no legal requirement on banning of smoking in public enclosed areas. He has not started to smoke again after he left Kuala Lumpur. Cathy has not made either of the promised payments, or bought the car. "
3,"Farrah runs a small catering business specialising in Malaysian cuisines. Her van breaks down when she was on her way to deliver her orders. She calls her local garage, Giant Auto Workshop, who agree to send out Harris, a mechanic to repair the van. Harris tells Farrah that the van cannot be repaired at the roadside but will have to be towed to the garage. Farrah agrees to this.

Harris winches up Farrah’s van in order to tow it to the garage, but a worn clip on the towing gear used by Harris slips open causing the van to fall. The van runs backwards over Farrah’s leg, breaking her ankle. The van’s rear window shatters in the fall and the food spills all over the road surface.

Displayed on the back of the towing vehicle is a notice: ‘All towing takes place at the customer’s risks.  Giant Auto Workshop and their employees accept no liability for any damage, injury, or any consequential loss, howsoever caused, while a motor vehicle is being towed.’"
4,"Ellie’s Montblanc pen with her name engraved on it was stolen. She puts an advertisement on her personal blog advertising a reward of RM1,000 to anyone who finds it. Frank, who has not seen the advertisement, discovers the pen in a library locker and takes it home. His course mate, Galvin, on seeing the pen, recognizes it as the one for which the reward has been offered, and shows Frank the advertisement in Ellie’s blog. Frank returns the pen to Ellie, but she refuses to pay RM 1,000, saying that the offer has been withdrawn. 

Frank knows that Galvin has been keen to buy his vintage Vespa scooter. On Sunday he tells Galvin that he has decided to sell at RM 5,000. Galvin says that he is very interested but would like to think about it. Frank says ‘I will assume that you want it, unless you tell me otherwise by Friday’.

On Thursday, Galvin meets Hassan who tells him that Frank has just agreed to sell the scooter to Jaya for RM6,000. Galvin immediately texted Frank accepting his offer. Later that day, however, Galvin changes his mind and calls on Frank to tell him to ignore the text message. Frank tells him that his deal with Jaya has fallen through, and he is still keen to sell it to Galvin."
5,"Lilian runs a small tailor shop in Putrajaya specialising in batik wear for women.  Her husband Mike owns a factory manufacturing clothes and is able to purchase his fabric much more cheaply than Lilian. On Friday night, after cooking Mike’s favourite meal, Lilian asked Mike if he would supply her shop with fabric at his cost price.  Mike said, “Of course darling.” 

Lilian then decides to expand her business to include batik wear for men and children.  On Monday she rings her dye supplier in Kuantan and talks to Neil.  She discusses her plans to expand her tailoring business and her need to order additional fabric dye colours suitable for silk, synthetic and cotton fabrics.  Neil tells Lilian that all the dye they supply is of the highest quality. 

Lilian orders 2 dozen of red dye at the price of RM50 each, to be delivered next Friday. She also inquires about gold and silver dyes, and is told by Neil that gold dyes are available for RM150 each, and silver for RM100.  Lilian tells Neil that she is prepared to pay RM130 for the gold dye and RM80 for the silver.  Lilian also tells Neil that if she doesn’t hear to the contrary, she will take 5 gold and 5 silver boxes of dye, to be delivered with the red dye on Friday.

On Friday morning, Lilian receives a delivery from Neil of 24 boxes of red dye. Lilian rings Neil and told him there are no gold or silver dyes.  Neil told Lilian he has decided not to supply them at Lilian’s price.

Lilian later calls Mike and asks him to send over some fabric she needs at cost price as agreed.  Mike replies that he will only provide her with fabric at market price. She protests and reminds him of last Friday evening.  He replies, “That was dinner, this is business.”

After Lilian hangs up, her assistant Olivia shows her an order for silk scarves on which she has been working using the red dye supplied by Neil. The dye is pale and streaky.  She tells Lilian there is a problem with the dye as it is not suitable for silk.  "
6,"Gary and his wife hold the Mooncake Festival each year on the grounds of their family estate in Kuala Selangor. The festival has increased in popularity, and this year they anticipate a record attendance. To cope with the extra demand, Gary contacts Hire-a-Loo Sdn. Bhd. to rent 10 portable toilets. Hire-a-Loo agrees to deliver and install all the toilets on 21st September, 2 days before the festival begins, and to collect them on 26th September, 2 days after the festival ends. 

On 21st September, when Hire-a-Loo attempts to install the toilets rented by Gary, it becomes apparent that a number of its portable toilets had been returned damaged by a previous customer, and would need to be repaired before further use. Gary and his wife, aware that the festival cannot go ahead without adequate toilet facilities, offer Hire-a-Loo an additional sum of RM5,000 to repair the portable toilets by 23rd September. Hire-a-Loo agrees and installs all the portable toilets by 23rd September. 

Monsoon rain in Kuala Selangor on 23-24 September badly affects attendance at the festival. When Hire-a-Loo comes to collect the portable toilets on 26th September, Gary and his wife say they can no longer afford to pay the additional RM5,000. "
